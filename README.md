## Copilot coding agent onboarding

This repository includes a short onboarding guide for automated coding agents and contributors: `.github/COPILOT-CODING-AGENT.md`.

If you're using an automated assistant, open that file first. It documents how to detect the project's language, run tests, and the safety rules the agent must follow.

If you're a human maintainer, please add canonical run/test instructions to `.github/COPILOT-CODING-AGENT.md` so automated agents can operate with confidence.
